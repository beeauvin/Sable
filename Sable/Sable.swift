/// ðŸ–¤ Sable is a Swift 6+ utility library that prioritizes beautiful API design
/// with natural language interfaces, handling complexity internally while presenting
/// simplicity externally.
///
/// At its core, Sable is a comprehensive reactive systems and application framework.
/// The current release focuses on foundational utilities and messaging components,
/// with future releases expanding into sophisticated reactive programming patterns
/// and architectural frameworks.
///
/// ## Design Philosophy
///
/// - **Natural Language APIs**: Creating interfaces that read like English for clearer intent
/// - **Progressive Disclosure**: Keeping simple things simple, with complexity opt-in
/// - **Goal-Oriented Design**: Prioritizing developer experience over convention
/// - **Comprehensive Type Safety**: Avoiding type erasure for strong compile-time safety
/// - **Modern Thread Safety**: Built on Swift's actor system and structured concurrency
/// - **Memory Safety**: Designed with proper resource lifecycle management
/// - **Non-Throwing Code Design**: Embracing Result type instead of throwable functions
/// - **Intentional Specificity**: Components with clear, specific intents
///
/// ## Available Modules
///
/// - **Sable**: Umbrella module providing unified import
/// - **SableFoundation**: Core Swift extensions and utilities
/// - **SablePulse**: Type-safe event messaging system
///
/// ## Future Modules
///
/// - **SableFlow**: Advanced reactive programming patterns
/// - **SableWeave**: Architectural framework for modular, testable applications
///
/// Compatible with Swift 6+ and Foundation across all Swift environments.
///
/// For detailed usage, see individual module documentation.
