/// A typed message handler that delivers pulses to a registered handler function.
///
/// `Channel` provides a safe, actor-isolated mechanism for delivering strongly-typed
/// pulse messages to registered handlers. It implements an ownership model where only
/// the component that created the channel can release it, ensuring that channels
/// remain active as long as needed by their owners.
///
/// Channels guarantee that any pulse sent to an unreleased channel will be delivered
/// to its handler, even if the handler executes asynchronously. Each delivered pulse
/// maintains its specified priority through the handling chain.
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a channel with a generated key
/// let (auth_channel, auth_key) = Channel.Create { pulse in
///   await process_auth_event(pulse.data)
/// }
///
/// // Create a channel owned by a specific component
/// let profile_channel = Channel(owner: profile_service) { pulse in
///   await update_user_profile(pulse.data)
/// }
///
/// // Create a channel with a custom key
/// let custom_key = UUID()
/// let notification_channel = Channel(key: custom_key) { pulse in
///   await send_push_notification(pulse.data)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Channels use a fire-and-forget model for pulse delivery, spawning tasks that
/// inherit the priority of the pulse being processed. This approach ensures that
/// channel operations remain non-blocking while maintaining appropriate prioritization.
