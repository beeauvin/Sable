/// Represents specific error conditions that can occur during channel operations.
///
/// `ChannelError` encapsulates the primary failure mode for channel operations:
/// attempting to interact with a channel that has been released.
///
/// This error is returned as part of a `ChannelResult` rather than thrown,
/// aligning with Sable's design principle of non-throwing code. This approach
/// encourages explicit error handling and predictable control flow.
///
/// ```swift
/// // Handle channel errors in a switch statement
/// switch result {
/// case .success:
///   continue_processing()
///
/// case .failure(.released):
///   reconnect_channel()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The error case is designed to provide just enough context for proper error
/// handling without exposing unnecessary implementation details.
@frozen public enum ChannelError: Error {
  /// Indicates that the channel has been released and can no longer process pulses.
  ///
  /// This error occurs when attempting to send a pulse to a channel that has been
  /// explicitly released, or when attempting to release a channel that has
  /// already been released.
  case released
