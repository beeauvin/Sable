/// A communication pathway with built-in bidirectional lifecycle awareness. Built on
/// `Channel` for chain-of-trust primitives.
///
/// `Stream` extends Sable's messaging architecture by providing a connection between
/// components with mutual awareness of lifecycle events. Unlike a regular `Channel`,
/// which offers unidirectional fire-and-forget messaging, a `Stream` establishes a
/// relationship where both ends can be notified when either side releases the connection.
///
/// This bidirectional lifecycle awareness enables components to properly clean up resources,
/// disconnect dependencies, or switch to alternative communication paths when a connection
/// is lost. The `Stream` conforms to `Channeling` to enable seamless integration with
/// existing channel-based architectures.
///
/// Key features:
/// - Unique identification through UUID for stream tracking in complex systems
/// - Bidirectional lifecycle awareness through notification channels
/// - Type-safe data passing with Pulse encapsulation
/// - Actor isolation for thread safety
/// - Conformance to `Channeling` for interoperability with regular channels
/// - Clean resource management when streams are released
///
/// Streams maintain three internal channels:
/// - A primary data channel for the main message flow
/// - Two notification channels for lifecycle events (source release and sink release)
///
/// This architecture enables robust connection management in distributed systems where
/// components need to react appropriately when their communication partners disconnect.
///
/// Example usage:
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a stream with data and lifecycle handlers
/// let resource_stream = Stream(
///   data_handler: { pulse in
///     // Process data flowing through the stream
///     await resource_service.process(pulse.data)
///   },
///   source_released_handler: { released_pulse in
///     // Handle source closing the stream
///     // Can access released_pulse.stream_id directly or
///     // released_pulse.meta.source.id for the same information
///     await resource_service.disconnect_source()
///   },
///   sink_released_handler: { released_pulse in
///     // Handle sink closing the stream
///     await resource_service.release_resources()
///   }
/// )
///
/// // Send data through the stream
/// let result = await resource_stream.send(data_pulse)
///
/// // Release the stream when no longer needed
/// await resource_stream.release()
/// ```
final public actor Stream<Data: Pulsable>: Channeling, Representable {

  /// and enables tracking in systems that manage multiple streams, such as Deltas.

  /// 3. Releasing all three internal channels
